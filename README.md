# readme-generator

## Description

The readme generator was created so that there was an easier and a more efficient way of creating a readme file by prompting the user to enter in the requeired information for a good readme. Through this project I was able to see how I can use informatin I learned about node and install packages to create an interactive file for this project

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
